# RideLoop Debug Log

## Date: 2025-10-15

### 1. CORS Policy Error
- **Error:** Access to XMLHttpRequest at 'http://localhost:8080/api/rentals/current/2' from origin 'http://localhost:3000' has been blocked by CORS policy: No 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' header is present on the requested resource.
- **Meaning:** Backend is not sending CORS headers, browser blocks request.
- **Fix:**
  - Ensure `CorsConfig.java` is present and correct.
  - Restart backend after changes.
  - Backend must be running and accessible at `http://localhost:8080`.

### 2. 404 Not Found
- **Error:** Failed to load resource: the server responded with a status of 404 ()
- **Meaning:** Frontend is requesting an endpoint that does not exist on the backend.
- **Fix:**
  - Check if `/rideloopdb/profiles/user/2` is a valid endpoint.
  - Update frontend to use correct endpoint if needed.

### 3. Network/Backend Down
- **Error:** net::ERR_FAILED
- **Meaning:** Frontend cannot reach backend. Backend may be down, or URL is incorrect.
- **Fix:**
  - Make sure backend is running on `localhost:8080`.
  - Try accessing `http://localhost:8080/api/incidents/getAll` in browser.

### 4. Actions Taken
- Verified CORS config exists in backend.
- No other CORS configs found.
- Advised to restart backend and check logs.

---

**Next Steps:**
- Restart backend after CORS changes.
- Check backend logs for errors.
- Verify endpoint URLs in frontend.
- If CORS errors persist, check backend logs and confirm backend is running.
